# Mushroom_edible_gallery
Predictive image analytics that going to show what type of mushroom you picked and if you can eat it.

## Hypotheses

**1. What mushroom have I picked?**<br>
- When a user uploading an image of a mushroom it can be analysed and predict 
what species of mushroom the image contains.<br><br>

**2. Can you eat the mushroom?**<br>
- By having a dataset with every category of mushroom species that handles the info if it´s edible or not. With this the accuracy of the image has to be over 80% so that the pickers don´t eat a toxic mushroom.<br><br>

**3. Are there any similiar mushrooms to this?**<br>
- When the system has identified the predictive species, there will also be images of similiar species that can be confused with.


## Business case

- **Users are interested to upload images on mushrooms and get a analysis of what species it can be.**<br>
*Goals:*<br>- Image visualisation of what type of species the user has uploaded.<br>- Image visualisation of species that can be cunfused with.

- **Users are interested to know if they can or can´t eat the mushroom.**<br>*Goals:*<br>- Have atleast 75% accuracy to predict a specie before telling if it´s toxic or not.
